- First page was to Create Flashcard which contains two form one for the name & description of the flashcard and also has functionality to add Images, second form was to create Dynamic Form which was created using FORMIK, which has individual card name & card description. After clicking the Create Button, the Flashcard will be created.

- The second page was to display all the user created cards, By default the user can only see 6 cards & after clicking the See All button all the remaining cards will be displayed.

- After clicking on the View Cards, User redirected to flashcard details page, where user can see all the cards on that flashcard, by clicking on the menu on the left side display the each selected card on the middle section,
